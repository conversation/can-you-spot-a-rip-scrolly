Rip currents are powerful, fast-moving channels of water that flow away from the shore, posing a significant hazard to swimmers and surfers. They are responsible for a large percentage of ocean rescues and fatalities each year. 

New safety guidelines, based on research by Surf Life Saving Australia and others, are aiming to help lower the risks at the beach this summer. However, it means that the advice many Australian got in school is now outdated. This quiz will teach you the latest recommendations, good luck!

## Survive a rip current

To recap, the latest advice is to avoid swimming sideways or parallel to the beach ‚Äì rips can also travel sideways so you might be swimming further into one or against the current.

1. **Stay calm**: Relax and don't panic.
2. **Don‚Äôt fight the current**: Don't try and swim back to the beach against the rip current flow.
3. **Signal for help**: Stay afloat, conserve your energy and signal or call for help to alert lifeguards or nearby surfers.
4. **Aim for whitewater**: If you are a very good swimmer, you can try to swim slowly to the side of the rip by aiming for the whitewater and breaking waves

## Prevention and Awareness

Rip currents occur on any beach that experiences breaking waves across a surf zone. Rips occur in all conditions including beautiful sunny days with small waves. There are also different types of rips that have different visual clues. If you would like to learn more about rip currents, please visit these educational resources:

- [www.scienceofthesurf.com](www.scienceofthesurf.com)
- [www.ripcurrentsafety.com](www.ripcurrentsafety.com)
- [www.beachsafe.org.au](www.beachsafe.org.au)

Of course the best way to avoid getting caught in a rip current is to always swim between the red and yellow flags on beaches patrolled by lifeguards and lifesavers. Safe swimming!
